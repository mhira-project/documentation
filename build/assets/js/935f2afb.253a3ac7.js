By creating a patient entry, the mental health care workers can access all the information about their patient in one site. The patient-centred view can be accessed by selecting the corresponding patient from the patient overview list.  The patient-centred view contains the subsections profile, departments, case managers, departments, caregivers, assessments and reports. To create a patient, the \u201ccreate patient\u201d button needs to be clicked. This will prompt the user to fill in the patient\'s profile.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"user-manual/reports":{"id":"user-manual/reports","title":"Reports","description":"Now that questionnaire data has been collected, the mental health care worker can proceed to access a report on the collected data. As an example, this could be the calculated scales of a given questionnaire represented as a graph which also shows the likelihood of the results compared to healthy control subjects. In case of repeated measures, the graph could show the severity of symptoms over time. A report could also link to psychoeducation materials or suggest treatments or further assessments based on the obtained results.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"user-manual/workflow":{"id":"user-manual/workflow","title":"Workflow","description":"The core workflow in MHIRA consists of creating a case (information representing a patient), then creating one or multiple assessment(s) for this patient which contain one or multiple questionnaires. Next, the questions in the assessment(s) need to be answered by an informant. Each assessment needs to be filled in by only one informant. Finally, a user with access to the case\u2019s information can access the report which results from the answered questionnaires.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
