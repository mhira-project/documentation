# Assessment titles


When creating an assessment, an 'assessment title' needs to be selected. 
Please refer to the [assessment section in the user manual](https://mhira-project.github.io/documentation/docs/user-manual/assessments) for more information about the field that is configured here. 

The clinical management needs to decide what types of assessments will be perfomed at the service.
A dropdown (instead of free text) is used  to unify these titles and to allow for seraching certain types of assessments.  

To add options to the dropdown field in question, please navigate to the 'Assessment title' menu under 'Administration' using the navigation side bar. 
Under this menu, you can add assessment titles to the dropdown menu.
