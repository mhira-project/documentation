# Assessments

Assessments are part of the core workflow (see Figure 1) which aims at facilitating the use of psychometric instruments (evidence-based assessment). After questionnaires have been uploaded and a patient has been entered, assessments can be created from the patient centred-view, or, alternatively, a ‘plan assessment’ menu accessed from the navigation bar.   
To create an assessment, it needs a title (e.g., ‘baseline assessment’) and an informant which can be of 3 types:
1) The patient himself/herself using a self-rating questionnaire,
2) a user of the MHIRA software which applies if expertise from another health care worker is required, or
3) a caregiver which can then be selected from a dropdown. 

Finally, to create an assessment one or multiple questionnaires need to be selected. Assessments can be selected to be either always open for completion or they can be restricted to a time frame during their creation. For example, an assessment could be planned to be filled in as a follow-up in which case they would be made available after a couple of months. Assessments can also be set to expire at a certain date after which they are no longer accessible. Once created, the assessments have different statuses (planned, open for competition, partially filled, expired or cancelled). If ‘open for completion’ or ‘partially completed’, the assessments can be accessed via a public link. The link can be opened in the same browser using a shortcut button. Alternatively, it can be sent by email or other means to the informant of the assessment.
To fill in assessments, it is not required to be an authenticated user. The recipient of the link will first access an overview page with all questionnaires included in the assessment. For each questionnaire, the number of answered questions in relation to the questions that are required to finalise the questionnaire are shown. Additionally, the number of optional questions is displayed. Finally, finalised questionnaires change colour and get a symbol to indicate that they are completed. A questionnaire can be accessed by clicking on it leading to a form that allows answering the questionnaire. Once all required questions of all questionnaires in the assessment are answered, the assessment can be submitted. However, data is written directly to the database, therefore data of unsubmitted assessments can be evaluated. The submission action closes the link and further changes to the questionnaires are no longer possible. 

The logged in user (a mental health care worker) can access an overview list of all assessments for a given patient (alternatively, there is a view showing assessments across patients). These lists also indicate the status of each assessment. Assessments can be managed from this, e.g., an assessment can be cancelled if it is no longer needed. Specific circumstances around an assessment can be commented on in a note field which remains always editable.
