Assessments can be selected to be either always open for completion or they can be restricted to a time frame during their creation. For example, an assessment could be planned to be filled in as a follow-up in which case they would be made available after a couple of months. Assessments can also be set to expire at a certain date after which they are no longer accessible.

The recipient of the link will first access an overview page with all questionnaires included in the assessment. For each questionnaire, the number of answered questions in relation to the questions that are required to finalise the questionnaire are shown. Additionally, the number of optional questions is displayed. Finally, finalised questionnaires change colour and get a symbol to indicate that they are completed. A questionnaire can be accessed by clicking on it leading to a form that allows answering the questionnaire. Once all required questions of all questionnaires in the assessment are answered, the assessment can be submitted.
