  "description": "Now that questionnaire data has been collected, the mental health care worker can proceed to access a report on the collected data. As an example, this could be the calculated scales of a given questionnaire represented as a graph which also shows the likelihood of the results compared to healthy control subjects. In case of repeated measures, the graph could show the severity of symptoms over time. A report could also link to psychoeducation materials or suggest treatments or further assessments based on the obtained results.",
